We use a synthetic control method to examine the effect of marijuana legalization on opioid overdose mortality rates in Colorado.

The legalization of recreational marijuana is a complicated, contentious issue that many
states are currently discussing. Its effect on opioid mortality is just one piece of the puzzle when
considering changes in legislation. Using a synthetic control model, we find evidence that the
legalization of recreational marijuana does not significantly increase opioid mortality rates in
Colorado. In fact, the marijuana legalization likely decreases opioid mortality by roughly 32%.
Each subsequent specification and robustness check provides further evidence that the
legalization of recreational marijuana decreased opioid deaths relative to synthetic Colorado. Our
analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that the legalization of recreational marijuana decreases
opioid mortality because it allows new dispensaries to open and serve a larger area than medical
dispensaries alone. The increased availability gives more individuals the option to use marijuana
for pain management rather than trying to obtain a prescription for opiates (Chan, Burkhart, &
Flyr, 2020). It also gives recreational drug users a legal option, possibly lowering the demand
for other substances that achieve similar effects but are illegal. Ultimately, our analysis provides
evidence that the substitution effect of marijuana is stronger than any ‘gateway drug’ effect
